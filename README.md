# American Sign Language to Text Converter  

This project is a Python-based application that converts American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into English text using computer vision and machine learning (Convolutional Neural Network). It leverages a camera to detect hand gestures, recognizes the patterns, and translates them into text.

## ‚ú® Benefits of the Program  
- **Accessibility**: Facilitates communication between people who use ASL and those who don‚Äôt understand it.  
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Provides instant translation of ASL to text, making it efficient for interactive use.  
- **Learning Aid**: Helps non-ASL users learn and practice sign language.  
- **Versatile**: Can be adapted for educational, professional, or casual environments.
